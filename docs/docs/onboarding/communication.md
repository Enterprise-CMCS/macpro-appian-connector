## GitHub Pull Requests (PRs)

GitHub Pull Requests are the primary vehicle to propose code changes to {{ site.repo.name }}.  A PR is always used to ship code to the master branch, with very few exceptions.

This project has PR templates which will be used automatically when you create a PR.  While the template sets up a PR with the fields that are typically required, you need to add the content to the various sections.

When authoring a PR, you typically want to be as descriptive as possible.  The goal is to write a PR as a complete description of the changeset, so that the PR and any underlying Issue can completely communicate the changes being made to someone otherwise unfamiliar with the work.  We want to be able to look back at the PR in a month, six months, or years on, and be able to fully understand what was changed and why.  Your audience for PRs are your peers, non technical stakeholders, and your future self.  High quality PRs are a hallmark of successful and maintainable projects; don't go short on them.

## Email

We don't like email.  However, it is used for access requests, onboarding, communication with external entities, and/or for any other communication that's difficult to facilitate another way.  

Don't hesitate to send an email if there's not a better way (do what you think is best), but avoid it by rule and use it by exception.
